# Calculator

## 1.1
Write a programm that adds input numbers together.
Use an array to save the numbers.
Use a while loop to iterate over the array.

```
# How many number would you like to add?
3
# 1:
7
# 2:
9
# 3:
5
# The soulution is: 21
```
## 1.2
Do the same for subtracting, dividing and multiplication.
But this time use a "for i" loop instead of while.
## 2
Now rewrite above programm so you can choose at the beginning what you want to do.
How could you change the code to use "for each"?
```
# What would you like to do?
# + or - or / or *
/
# How many numbers would you like to divide?
```
